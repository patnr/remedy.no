In 2020, the petroleum activity on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS)
emitted an estimated 12.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases (GHG),
of which 84.7% originated from gas turbines,
much of it spent in drilling and injection operations.
In order to reach climate targets for 2030 and 2050,
the industry is in pressing need of extending its decision management tools
to include emissions of GHG.

REMEDY builds on established ensemble methods to develop methodologies needed
for such a comprehensive workflow,
applying state-of-the-art methods for history matching,
optimization, and decision making to determine the optimal drilling schedules
and drainage strategies that minimize GHG emissions and energy usage
while maximizing oil recovery.
