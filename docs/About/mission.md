# Mission

## Overall objective

The overarching goal is to craft an integrated reservoir and emission
management system that slashes CO2 and GHG emissions, bolsters energy
efficiency in the NCS, and maximizes NPV. Seamless integration into operators'
ensemble tools is emphasized.

## Research focus

REMEDY endeavors to refine ensemble-based reservoir management workflows,
amplifying their methods. It has a keen emphasis on fortifying ensemble-based
optimization and decision-making processes that consider geological and
operational uncertainties.

Applications of REMEDY will tackle the challenge of optimizing reservoir
development and production strategies while minimizing energy consumption and
curbing GHG emissions.

## Deliverables

REMEDY strives to yield enhanced reservoir management workflows equipped with
refined optimization and decision methods. These advancements will empower NCS
operators to curtail CO2 emissions during field development and production.
