In order to reach climate targets for 2030 and 2050, the industry is in pressing need of extending its decision management tools to include emissions of GHG.</p> <p>REMEDY builds on established ensemble methods to develop methodologies needed for such a comprehensive workflow, applying state-of-the-art methods for history matching, optimization, and decision making to determine the optimal drilling schedules and drainage strategies that minimize GHG emissions and energy usage while maximizing oil recovery.</p>"},{"location":"demo/","title":"Demonstration of markdown extensions","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>The markup possibilities are truly impressive.
